Particle WiFi Manager
====================

Example class that manages the WiFi connection. 

It always falls back to the WiFI softap mode (listen).
For example if the network is not available, or if the password is wrong.

It automatically will try to reconnect of the network has been found again.

Suggestions are welcome.
